# GitHub HTML Preview

View browser rendered HTML on GitHub, instead of source code. This is a fork of the excellent [htmlpreview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/) project by [Jerzy Głowacki](http://niute.ch/).

## Synopsis

This project allows users to view how HTML source code hosted on GitHub looks when rendered by the browser. Instead of only reading HTML source code, quickly glance at its appearance before debugging or making other minor edits. Please read Jerzy Głowacki's [description of htmlpreview](https://github.com/htmlpreview/htmlpreview.github.com/blob/master/readme.md) to understand how this project functions.

## Setup

This particular fork is maintained to enable the [GitPreview](http://github.com/kaivalyar/GitPreview) chrome extension to function.

However, to use directly, prepend `kaivalyar.github.io/htmlpreview/?` to the URL of the HTML file you are browsing on GitHub. Alternativeley, navigate to [kaivalyar.github.io/htmlpreview/](kaivalyar.github.io/htmlpreview/) from your browser and copy-paste the URL of the HTML file hosted on GitHub.

## Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to write to [kaivalyaraw@gmail.com](mailto:kaivalyaraw@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you.
